# Experimental-TicTacToe
This game plays exactly like the original TicTacToe, the only catch is that each player limited to only three X's or O's. After the third X or O, the first one disapears, then the second, and so on, until someone wins the game. This game cannot result in a draw, and has an average play time of 5 minutes, although games can be as short as 3 moves or as long as 50.
